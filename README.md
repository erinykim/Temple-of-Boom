# Tennessee Morrisett and the Temple of Boom

This project will help avid explorer and professor of archeology Tennessee Morrisett claim the Orb of Zot in the Temple of BOOM. 
You will help him explore an unknown cavern under the Temple, claim the Orb, and get out before the cavern collapses. 
Additionally, there will be great rewards for those who help Tennessee line his pockets with fallen gold on the way out. Much success!
